# icndb

This project was originally using the Internet Chuck Norris Database (icndb), but that API was deprecated. Now the project is using https://api.chucknorris.io.

I have a way to select a random category (escluding the explicit category); however, I have not been able to get the api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category} to work (getting 400 Bad Request, same if I try the API url directly). I am using api.chucknorris.io.jokes/random until and if I figure it out.
